      <description>Buzz Words Galore When I am asked what OstrichDB is I have to recall back to an imaginary script that I keep stored in my mind. This script contains seemingly every buzzword one could use to descibe a crappy side project that they have been working on. Lets count the buzz words together. OstrichDB is a simple(0), lightweight(1), severless(2), document-based(3), JSON-esque(4), NoSQL(5), database system that is designed to be for on local machines for small projects. Thats it. That is the script. I have said it so many times that I can recite it in my sleep. But what does it all mean?</description>
