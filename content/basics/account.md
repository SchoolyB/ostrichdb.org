Upon the succesful installation and running of OstrichDB, the user will be greeted with a prompt that askes them to
create an admin account. Enter a username and password that you will remember!

Note: Be sure not to use any private information in either the username or password when creating an account.


Once you have successfully created a password you will need to relaunch OstrichDB.
```bash
$ ./main.bin
```

Now you can log in with the information you provided when creating an account.
Once logged in you can now access the OstrichDB command line. You will be given an indicator to the left of your
terminal to signify that you are currently in an OstrichDB session. That indicator will look like this:
```bash
OST>>>
```

From the command line you are now able to perform several operations. To continue learning about OstrichDB, head over to the [Learning OstirchDB](/intermediate/) chapter.
